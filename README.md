# Separaty Engine

## Description

Separaty Engine is a game engine made in C++ for learning purposes. 

This project has been created by UPC-CITM students with the objective of improving our programming skills to be more efficient and clean. For doing it, we have focused in the basic internal tools, functions and processes that we normally do not take into account during the development of a videogame.  

It is important to highlight that our engine is free to use and everyone can give us feedback to continue improving it!

Obviously, we believe that this is not necessary to emphasize, but we will say it anyway: **This Engine will be Better than Unity one day!**
